# Fall 2019 CS 4395 Objective
             
The objective of this study is to research, identify, analyze Machine Learning approaches to processing social media data, specifically from Twitter, emphasizing classification and clustering of accounts, e.g. fake accounts. This entails: 
•	Review Machine Learning Classification/Clustering techniques
•	Develop NLP skills to process serialized text data (extract, explore, and model data)
•	Use multiple types of account data to inform the model(s)
•	Utilize a NoSQL database for text storage
•	Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insight on trends


# Materials covered/Justification

Natural Language Processing, Supervised Classification, Unsupervised Clustering – after taking CS 4347, I found myself wanting to delve deeper into specific methods/techniques and apply them to research within the social media sphere on a large data set. Although there is an Artificial Intelligence course, it does not focus on NLP or Machine Learning as it relates to social media.
